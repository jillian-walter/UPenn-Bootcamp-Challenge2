VBA Challenge for Week 2:
Utilized class recordings, personal notes from live classes and studying free resources on https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/language/reference/user-interface-help/visual-basic-language-reference

On Mac, I was not able to save the script for the challenge as a .VBA file, so I just added my script into a text file.
